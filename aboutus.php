the world's largest seed bank</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="st">Pioneers of the cannabis seed industry</h2><br>
        <p class="st1">Sensi Seeds pioneered the cannabis seed industry in 1985. Today, the company is the world’s largest cannabis seedbank with over<br>500 varieties. These genetics and the brand name have become true classics in the cannabis community. The Dutch government chose<br>Sensi Seeds genetics to develop the medicinal cannabis supplied by pharmacies.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="st3">Bringing cannabis into the public eye</h2><br>
 <p class="st4">Sensi Seeds aims for the normalization of cannabis use and recognition of the plant’s therapeutic and industrial benefits. This led the<br>company to open the world’s first cannabis museum in 1985. The Hash Marihuana & Hemp Museum is now present in both Amsterdam and<br>Barcelona and has welcomed over two million visitors.<br><br>
 Together with the museum, Sensi Seeds regularly hosts the  Cannabis Culture <br>Awards. This award celebrates those who have taken a stand for<br>the acceptance of cannabis. Winners include Sir Richard Branson, and former Prime Minister of the Netherlands Dries van Agt.
